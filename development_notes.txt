vDirect Development notes:

The code can be subdivided into two parts:
	1. Argument Parsing
	2. Making requests

ad 1) The argparse module is used in main.py, and several subparsers are defined:
The parsing is structured as follows:
Parser      vsearch_parser      species_search_parser
                                protein_search_parser
                                vog_search_parser

            vsummmary_parser    species_summary_parser
                                protein_summary_parser
                                vog_summary_parser

            vfetch_parser       protein_fetch_parser
                                vog_fetch_parser

These parsers more or less correspond to the different functions implemented in the VOGDB-API. The requests are made in the API_requests module, and upon receiving the response in the main module, it’s status code is checked, and error messages given, if applicable.

ad 2) In the API_request module, every request has its own function. A Dictionary called “params” holds the parameters, and these, along with the base URL is used to make a request to the API.


Testing:
Testing of vDirect comprises the checking of the created URLs against the correct URLs from the VOGDB-API.
